        <p>Photoreceptors in the retina, known as rods and cones, play a crucial role in afterimage formation.
            Rods and cones contain millions upon millions of specialized photopigment molecules.
            When exposed to light, these photopigment molecules in the photoreceptors undergo a process called bleaching,
            where the molecules change structure and temporarily lose their ability to respond to light.
            This leads to a temporary desensitization of the photoreceptors.
            Negative afterimages result from adaptation in the rods and cones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Negative afterimages are seen as the complementary colors of the stimulus that caused them
            and are usually caused after a prolonged period of looking at/around (see the attention section!) the stimulus.
            They are best seen against a brightly light background, which is why the demonstration cuts to
            bright white when the stimulus disappears.
