        <h2>All-Seeing Eye</h2>
        <p>
            A common definition of illusions is a case of non-veridical perception of the external world.
            This can be related to the concept of the All-Seeing Eye, whether you believe in it or not.
            A translation of that definition might be: an illusion is a case of not seeing what the All-Seeing Eye sees.

        <p>
            Afterimages challenge the notion of direct awareness of physical objects,
            as they are internal visual experiences that do not correspond to external stimuli.
            This relates to philosophical debates on sense-data and internal representations,
            questioning whether our perceptions directly reflect the external world or are constructed by our minds.

        <h2>Umwelts</h2>
        <p>
            A database on illusions from the University of Glasgow wrote,
            "Afterimages figure in debates as to whether we are directly aware of physical objects or,
            rather, internal (mental, private) objects called sense-data." Based on this debate,
            we might argue that afterimages are a figment of our Umwelts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of Umwelts refers to the unique perceptual worlds experienced by different organisms.
            Afterimages reflect personal perceptual experiences, highlighting how individual sensory systems
            and neural processes shape our subjective reality.
