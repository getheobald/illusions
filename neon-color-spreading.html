            Neon color spreading is an illusion where a color appears to spread beyond its physical location
            or boundaries, creating a perception of an area that is filled in with the neon color even though
            that color is not actually there.

            A seminal paper by Shimojo et al. in 2001 found very interesting overlap between neon
            color spreading and afterimages. They found that viewing a neon color spreading illusion
            led not only to an afterimage of the content in the stimulus, but also to an afterimage
            of the filled-in surface. This afterimage of the filled-in part was caused by no part of
            the stimulus and was purely perceptual.

            Essentially, neon color spreading being present in the afterimage suggests that afterimages
            aren't solely created by adaptation in the retina; they also involve adaptation in the cortex.
