            I lay awake in bed in the morning a couple weeks ago, arms resting on my face.
            My arm was putting pressure on my eyeball, and when I pulled my arm away,
            there was a greenish spot in my vision, an aftereffect of the pressure.
            As it turns out, this is a "pressure phosphene," caused by mechanical stimulation
            of the photoreceptor cells which then send signals to the brain, resulting in the (false) perception of light.

            This phenomenon has happened to me countless times before, but I never thought much of it…
            until this occurrence. This course has made me see my visual system, perception, and mind in
            new ways and question things to which I hadn't given a second thought before.
        </p>
        <p>
            I investigated the greenish spot of light I saw, and at first believed it to be an afterimage.
            A bit more research revealed, however, that afterimages result from light stimuli, while the term
            for non-veridical spots or colors resulting from non-light stimuli is "phosphene."
        </p>
        <p>
            Though afterimages weren't the original impetus for my research, I think the topic has stronger
            connections to course content than phosphenes. I decided I wanted to pursue them further,
            learn a little more, and create a semi-interactive site for others to learn more as well.

            It wasn't until after I had begun this project that I realized an "afterimage" is the perfect theme.
            This project is supposed to represent what I will remember and look back at in 10 years?
            Then that's exactly what it is… an afterimage of Reality of Illusions.
