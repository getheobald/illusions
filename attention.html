            Multiple studies have shown that attention during adaptation can weaken negative afterimages.
            That is why, in the demonstration on the home page, the instructions specify to focus on
            the white dot on the bridge of the nose.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Proof of concept:</b> go back to the demonstration and try it again.
            This time, instead of focusing on the white dot, move your eyes around the image and focus on it.
            Watch what happens to your afterimage!
        </p>

            Similarly, attention has been found to weaken the afterimages of color-spread surfaces,
            which was also mentioned in the paper by Shimojo et al.

            Another paper on the topic was published by Armin Lak in 2008, who performed two experiments
            on the impact of attention on the duration of afterimages of color-spread figures.
            The results agreed with previous research, showing that attention during the adaptation
            phase weakened the afterimage.

            Further research in 2010 by van Boxtel et al. explored the opposing effects of
            attention and consciousness on afterimages. They found an inverse relationship:
            while attention on the stimulus reduces afterimage strength and sharpness,
            conscious awareness of the stimulus can increase it.
